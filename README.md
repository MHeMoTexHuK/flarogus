# Flarogus bot
Github-hosted discord bot. Mogus.

Written in kotlin, uses Kord.

# Deployment
The bot is running on github actions (since I didn't find any rules prohibiting this, i assume that's legal).

A single workflow run lasts for 40 hours (the bot restarts 8 times during this period). I could make it run on schedule or
make a recursive workflow but I'm way too lazy
